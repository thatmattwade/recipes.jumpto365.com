# Connect the List to your App

Head back to your PowerApps 

![](2022-09-22-14-50-42.png)

In my case I opened Teams in a new browser tab, so all I have to do is to select the first tab 

## Open the "Data" panel

Within the left rail (marked by the surrounding read box), select the database icon ![](2022-09-22-14-53-27.png)

Select **Connect directly (cloud service)**

Here is becomes tricky. Once you are presented with the **Connect to SharePoint site** panel, you have 2 options. You can either enter the SharePoint URL or select amongst Recent sites.  The later is super handy, but as the list of recent sites have a build in delay, it will not capture if you just have created a list (which is stored in a site, a site which is created automatically when you create a Microsoft Team) 

In this case I have cheated and waited a day for the list to get updated with the Teams that I created earlier, if you haven't got that patience, check
