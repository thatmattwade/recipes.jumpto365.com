# Create a List

A list is like a worksheet in a spreadsheet, a place to store structured information. You can look at it as a table in a database.

## Add a Tab in Teams

In this case I will work under the assumption that you uses Microsoft Teams, and that you are the owner of one. Navigate to the channel where you like to add a List. 

:::info
You can add a list in any channel on any Team. In this case I have named the Team with the same name as the App. That is not a requirement.

Enter the name of the first item, name it e.g. **Item 1** and select **Save**

Repeat the step a few time and name the next items **Item 2**, **Item 3** etc.

You should end up having at least 3 items


## Disclaimer

Lists can be used for a lot. Lists is stored in SharePoint, so when you create a Microsoft Teams Team, you implicitly creates a SharePoint site. Lists have some limitations though. To be on the safe side, you will have no problems using Lists for your application if you store less than 500 items (can be increased to 2000). But if you design your" data model" right, there is practically no limits to how many items you store in your lists, the 2000 items limit is only affecting the view of items.
