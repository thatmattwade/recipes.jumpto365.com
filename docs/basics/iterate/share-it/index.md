# Make it Discoverable

:::info Chefs tip

Your app has been published, but is not readily findable by your audience. This article provides a number of common and best-practice methods for communicating to your audience that the app is available for use. Choose one or mix and match. The point is that you want your users to be able to find and use your app, so meet them where they are.

==Link to your app==
While there are more integrated ways to share a Power App and get it in front of its audience, sometimes a link from an organization-wide communication is the simplest option that affords the most use and highest response rate.

A call to action in an email, Yammer post, or video training description can meet that need, but you’ll require a web address to point your readers to.  This is a common use case for making a Power App available to users, so we have published instructions on our blog at https://jum.to/powerapplink.

This link can be accessed both on desktop and mobile. For the best experience, your users should install the Power Apps mobile app from their respective mobile app store and log in before accessing any apps on their mobile device. If you use InTune and CompPortal to control apps that can be installed on organization phones or tablets, you need to approve the Power Apps app for your users to install.

The link to a Power App can be long and ugly. You may want to use a link shortener to make the link more palatable or even customized to something like org.co/applink. Bit.ly is the best-known tool for the job, but tinyurl.com works well in a pinch.

==Publish your app to the Teams app store==
An easy way to get the app out in front of everyone is to publish it to the Teams app store so everyone can access it and add it where they need to. You can even push it out to the app bar of all users if you have Microsoft 365 Admin Center access (or know someone who does). This is a common use case for making a Power App available to users, so we have published instructions on our blog at https://jum.to/powerappstore.

==Add your app as a tab in a Teams channel==
Another way to make your app available in Teams is to add it as a tab in a channel in a Team or multiple channels in multiple Teams. This makes it easy to find in the right context, as opposed to adding it to the app bar (the previous section). Because this app likely needs to be accessible to the entire organization, adding the app as a tab in an org-wide Team can be useful.  This is a common use case for making a Power App available to users, so we have published instructions on our blog at https://jum.to/powerapptab.

==Add your app to a SharePoint page==
SharePoint is a great place to embed a Power App. Using the Power Apps web part on a modern SharePoint page, you can make your app available right in front of people where they already are.  This can be great for an intranet home page. This is a common use case for making a Power App available to users, so we have published instructions on our blog at https://jum.to/powerappsp.

This option is also useful if you already use SharePoint page tabs in Microsoft Teams or you take advantage of the Microsoft Viva Connections feature that lets you set your SharePoint home site as the Home app in Microsoft Teams. 

==Publish as a standalone app for iOS or Android==
SUre, users can find your app in the Power Apps mobile app, but that's not the best experience. Maybe your app is important enough to be its own app that they can install from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. You can use the "Wrap" feature in Power Apps to publish to those stores or, if you're using InTune to control organizational devices, publish to the Comp Portal app. Learn more: https://jum.to/3TLgPy6

==Make your app a promoted result in Microsoft Search==
A SharePoint administrator in your organization can tag an app with certain keywords—even reserved words for key apps—so the app pops up at the top of Microsoft Search results (in SharePoint, the Microsoft 365 hub, and elsewhere), pointing potential users to the app directly without having to depend on other search methods (or the lack of them in Power Apps). This promoted result is known as a Microsoft Search 'bookmark' and is managed from the ''Search and Intelligence'' section of the Microsoft 365 admin center. Learn more: https://jum.to/3F82rvu
