# Operations

This is really what I hate most, having to "look back" and figure out why things I once made "so perfect" is failing.

I have a few tips and tricks that I have learned over the years that I will share with you.

## Use the right tools 
Or at least use tools which you are familiar with. For me that is Windows, I have touched upon Unix and Linux, but early I decided to specialize on the Microsoft stack.
