## About the Head Chef
I'm Niels Gregers Johansen, born many years a go in a country far far up northern Europe (Denmark). 

I have been working with IT for close to 40 years, and I have been working with Microsoft technologies for more than 30 years.

For years I have been working and communicating internally with my colleagues, but now I have decided to share my knowledge with the world. 

I wish you a good day and I hope you find something useful here.

Bon appetit!
